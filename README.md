M<sup>3</sup> for Batch Processing
====

M<sup>3</sup> for Batch Processing (M<sup>3</sup> for BP) is a data processing engine that fully extracts the performance of multicore/multiprocessor-based 2-way servers.<br>
M<sup>3</sup> for BP is designed for [Asakusa Framework](https://github.com/asakusafw/asakusafw), with a focus on small-to-medium volume of data (less than tens of GB).  For this volume of data, M<sup>3</sup> for BP provides much better performance and much lower TCO for applications built on Asaskusa Framework than do MapReduce and Spark.
